## Description 
**Project AGOS** is a PUP Ferry Terminal Information Management designed to offer centralized and organized information about the ferry’s scheduled trips while implementing the concept of **Abstraction** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This system aims to provide necessary details that will be beneficial for both the **passengers** and the **ferry’s operators**.


## Usage

### **Choose**
Whether the user is an **admin** or **passenger**.  
- If **admin**, they will be redirected to the admin portal.  
- If **passenger**, they will be redirected to the passenger view.

### **Admin**
If the user is an **admin**, click the admin option and enter the required credentials.  
Upon successful login, the admin can access and preview the current ferry schedule.  
The admin is prompted with the option to **add/edit**.  

### **Add/Edit Schedule**
If the admin selects ‘add/edit’ to revise the ferry’s schedule, they will be directed to a new section/table with additional options:  
- **Add Row**  
- **Delete**  
- **Edit**  
- **Add Passenger**  
- **Save**  

#### **Add Row**
The admin can add rows to insert necessary details (_Trip ID, Body No, Route, Location, Estimated Time of Arrival, Seats Available, and Status_) in the system.
